## About me 
I am Guo Xiaojun. 21 years old. This is the third-trimester in the JCU.My interests include artificial intelligence, basketball, and video-games. I hope I can learn some course related to the AI in the future.

## Lessons Learned
- **Readability Counts:** Clear code is better than clever code. It's essential for others and future you.
- **Consistency:** Following naming conventions and styles makes the code predictable and easier to understand.
- **Refactoring:** Refactor regularly to improve code quality without changing its functionality.
